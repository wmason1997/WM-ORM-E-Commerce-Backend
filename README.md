## Description <a name="description"></a> 
I built the back end for an e-commerce site with Express.js, Sequelize, and a MySQL database. The routes are displayed on Insomnia.

## Video Example Walkthrough <a name="video-example-walkthrough"></a>
Here is a link to the video example walkthrough hosted on Google Drive: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kvI7s30XCIo8-Wutm5VH2Vio82Ttf4Ro/view](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kvI7s30XCIo8-Wutm5VH2Vio82Ttf4Ro/view). I showed the interaction with the command line interface (CLI) by entering "npm i", entering the MySQL shell to login and "source db/schema.sql" and quitting out, seeding the database with "node seeds/index.js" and finally running "node server.js" before going to the specified port on Insomnia to show all the CRUD routes.

## Installation <a name="installation-instructions"></a>
Clone this repository and create your own .env environment with your MySQL credentials.

## Usage <a name="usage-instructions"></a>
Follow the steps outlined in the video example walkthrough and in the README above. Set-up your Insomnia account and environment first.

## Credits <a name="credits"></a>
I used the Develop folder from Module 13-SQL of the [UCSD-VIRT-FSF-PT-09-2023-U-LOLC](https://git.bootcampcontent.com/University-of-California---San-Diego/UCSD-VIRT-FSF-PT-09-2023-U-LOLC) GitLab repository as starter code and the mini-project as a reference. Thank you, user mvpache!

I had a tutoring session with Mila Hose on 01/10/2024. Mila helped me to add and format post routes to each of my routes files as well as better understand Insomnia. Thanks, Mila!
